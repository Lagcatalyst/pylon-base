# Warning: physical constants. Don't mess with these unless you know what you're doing,
# lest you destabilize the heat simulation.
# If you *think* you know what you're doing, I would only adjust the heat loss coefficient
# and the emissivity.
specific-heat: # J/(kg*K); these define how fast the smeltery heats up/cools down
  air: 717.0
  fluid: 215.0
density: # kg/m^3; these define how much mass is in the smeltery
  air: 1.2
  fluid: 698.0
heat-loss-coefficient: 10.0 # W/Â°C; defines the rate of conductive cooling; i.e., cooling rate at low temperatures
emissivity: 0.9 # unitless; defines the rate of radiative cooling; i.e., cooling rate at high temperatures
